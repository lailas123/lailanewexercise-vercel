I’d start by gathering information and i’d carefully read the customer's request or description of the issue. After this, i’d Conduct preliminary research to gain a basic understanding of the framework or technology in question. Even if i have to read documentation, tutorials, or community forums to familiarize myself with its architecture, common issues, and troubleshooting strategies.
<ul>
  <li>What specific steps are you taking when encountering the issue?</li>
  <li>Can you provide the exact error message or output you're seeing?</li>
  <li>Are there any recent changes or updates made?</li>
<li>Have you encountered similar issues in the past, and if so, how were they resolved?</li>
<li>Can you share any relevant configuration files or code snippets that might be contributing to the problem?</li>
</ul>

My next step would be to try to isolate the issue by reproducing it in a controlled environment (freedemo account/test account etc) and after that i’d document each step taken and any observations made during the reproduction process to aid in troubleshooting.
After all these steps if the issue remains unresolved after my investigation, i’d consider seeking assistance from colleagues, online communities, or official support channels for the framework or technology.
