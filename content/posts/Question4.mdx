Edge Functions are ideal for executing lightweight logic at the edge of the network, closer to the end-users. They are suitable for tasks that require immediate response times and minimal latency, such as URL redirects, header manipulation, or simple content personalization.
Serverless Functions are suitable for executing more complex backend logic or handling dynamic data processing tasks. They are invoked on-demand in response to specific HTTP requests or events.
Edge Middleware allows you to apply custom logic to incoming requests or outgoing responses at the edge, similar to middleware in traditional backend frameworks. It's useful for tasks such as request/response logging, authentication, authorization, or caching.
