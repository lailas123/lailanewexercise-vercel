Thank you for reaching out to us. We understand that you would like your project not to be indexed by search engines.

To prevent search engines from indexing your site, you can employ a couple of methods:
You can create a "robots.txt" file in the root directory of your website and include directives that instruct search engine crawlers not to index your site. Here's an example of how to disallow indexing for all pages:
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
Another method is to include a "robots" meta tag in the HTML of your websiteâ€™s pages. You can add the following meta tag within the `<head>` section of your HTML:
`<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">`

By implementing one or both of these methods, you can effectively prevent search engines from indexing your site.

If you need further assistance or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

In drafting the response, I provided the customer with two commonly used methods for preventing search engines from indexing their site: using a "robots.txt" file and adding a "robots" meta tag to their HTML.

These methods were chosen because they are widely recognized and supported by search engines, making them reliable options for achieving the customer's objective.
